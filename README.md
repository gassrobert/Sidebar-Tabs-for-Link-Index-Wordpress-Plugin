# Sidebar Link Index
WordPress widget plugin for displaying lists of links in tabular format. 

This widget plugin displays tabs connected to lists of links. It is meant for indexing sub pages for websites.

The widget form in the admin console starts with an empty tab name textbox that can be filled and saved.

Set the number of tabs, the heading of each tab and the number of links for each tab, and then press the Save button.

Once all the tabs are saved each of the tabs are originally closed.

Click on the tab heading to add or edit the link names and the link URLs. In order to save a sub heading enter the text of the sub heading as the link name and then enter # as the URL.

Once the sub headings and links have all been entered and saved the widget will now display horizontal tabs with the list of links beneath each.
